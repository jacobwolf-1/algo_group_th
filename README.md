Question #2
To anwser this question I will be implementing a linked list. My implementation will fulfil the requirements of the assignment, with push, pop, peek, and size functions to operate on the list. The reason I came up with this solution was because, having taken CS 143 last quarter, I have worked with creating linked lists in C, so I figured I could apply that knowledge here.
